# What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of securing computer systems, networks, and data from attacks, outages, and other complications (typically malicious in nature, though not exclusively). The professional domain of cybersecurity is broad, being inclusive of hyper-specialized technical subject-matter experts, strategic policy implementers, criminal investigators, and more. That breadth is extended by the considerable depth that each respective field/subfield possesses. The work involved in securing the technology we all own, use, and operate every day is a mammoth collective effort.

This subreddit is for discussing cybersecurity topics, research, and emergent threats/findings. To that end, we have updated our Wiki/FAQ in order to serve this subreddit's community writ large; we have endeavored to collect guidance, best practices, and supplemental information in order to help direct people towards answers that they might have. However, if you cannot find what you are looking for, please consider posing your question in the weekly rolling "Mentorship Monday" threads pinned to the top of the subreddit.

# I'm new to Cybersecurity; where do I begin?

If you are newer to the space, it can be really challenging wrapping your head around cybersecurity as a profession (let alone what you need to learn/perform in order to become a part of it).

Early on, you're going to want to learn more about the industry in order to help inform your decision about whether or not cybersecurity is for you; such knowledge will also help guide your initial career trajectory based on what roles/responsibilities look attractive. Know this however: careers in this space typically do not manifest quickly, easily, or cheaply. Most people invest years of their lives (and a non-trivial amount of out-of-pocket expenses in college tuition / certification exam fees) before they attain their first full-time cybersecurity job - let alone the one they are envisioning doing.

===TODO: See <link to 'What it's like'>===

If you think that you do want to pursue a career, then you'll want to buoy your knowledgebase with understanding Information Technology (IT) & Computer Science (CompSci) fundamentals more broadly; these are the parent domains that the cybersecurity profession was built upon and whose foundations extend into much of the work we do to this day. Some people pursue degrees for example, although [this is certainly not the only approach to consider](https://bytebreach.com/posts/do-i-need-a-degree/).

===TODO: See <link to 'Type of degree'>===

Eventually, you'll need to work on improving your employability. This manifests in a variety of ways, but one of the most common (besides fostering a pertinent work history) is accumulating relevant industry-recognized certifications. Working on our employability is a life-long effort that should be thoughtful, deliberate, and carefully planned.

# What is the work like?

Cybersecurity is not a monolith. There are many, many different kinds of roles that exist and all of them have varying responsibilities:

* You have folks who concern themselves with networks: how machines and users engage one-another and how they can communicate safely and securely.
* You have folks concerned with hardware: how humans and machines interface, where systems critical to the health and well-being of dozens (or millions) or people are at stake.
* You have folks concerned with data: how information in all its forms is meaningful, where preserving its integrity and assuring its availability are paramount.
* You have folks who think more strategically: how the "big picture" matters and how that - in turn - leads to organizations prescribing policies for everyone to follow and assuring they are enforced.

Categorically, the various disparate roles and responsibilities that collectively contribute to professional cybersecurity are often lumped together as being either "red" (i.e. offensively-oriented) or "blue" (i.e. defensively-geared). Classically, jobs that lean more "red" might include (but are not limited to):

* Read teamers
* Penetration testers
* AppSec Engineers
* Exploit developers
* Bug Bounty Hunters

While jobs that might lean more "blue" include (but are not limited to):

* Malware analysts
* SOC analysts
* Security Engineers
* GRC functionaries
* Incident Responders

Neither of the above lists are exhaustive by any means. Moreover, any given job is likely to have functional responsibilities that operate more offensively/defensively at times. Occassionally, the color-coding schema of red/blue invokes "purple" teams, where traditionally offensively-oriented staff are embedded with defensively-geared staff in order to make both better at their respective jobs.

> Note: This color-coding schema is independent of black/grey/white -hat activities (which denote a legal/ethical scale of behaviors from criminal to law-abiding) and white/grey/black -box activities (which reflect a knowledge scale of behind-the-curtain foresight for a given event from complete disclosure to full-discovery).

Your best bet to figuring out what a day-in-the-life is like in cybersecurity would be to first more narrowly discover what it is you want to do within the space. Just remember that ultimately each of us is - in some way - concerned with promoting a greater degree of confidence that the technologies we engage with operate in the way they are intended to.
