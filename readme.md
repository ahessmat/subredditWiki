# What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of securing computer systems, networks, and data from attacks, outages, and other complications (typically malicious in nature, though not exclusively). The professional domain of cybersecurity is broad, being inclusive of hyper-specialized technical subject-matter experts, strategic policy implementers, criminal investigators, and more. That breadth is extended by the considerable depth that each respective field/subfield possesses. The work involved in securing the technology we all own, use, and operate every day is a mammoth collective effort.

# What is /r/cybersecurity?

This subreddit is for discussing cybersecurity topics, research, and emergent threats/findings. To that end, we have updated our Wiki/FAQ in order to serve this subreddit's community writ large; we have endeavored to collect guidance, best practices, and supplemental information in order to help direct people towards answers that they might have. However, if you cannot find what you are looking for, please consider posing your question in the weekly rolling "Mentorship Monday" threads pinned to the top of the subreddit.

# I'm new to Cybersecurity; where do I begin?

If you are newer to the space, it can be really challenging wrapping your head around cybersecurity as a profession (let alone [what you need to learn/perform in order to become a part of it](https://roadmap.sh/cyber-security), which can feel daunting).

Early on, you're going to want to learn more about the industry in order to help inform your decision about whether or not cybersecurity is for you; such knowledge will also help guide your initial career trajectory based on what roles/responsibilities look attractive. Know this however: careers in this space typically do not manifest quickly, easily, or cheaply. Most people invest years of their lives (and a non-trivial amount of out-of-pocket expenses in college tuition / certification exam fees) before they attain their first full-time cybersecurity job - let alone the one they are envisioning doing.

Related: see the "[What it's like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/wiki/index/#wiki_what_is_the_work_like.3F)" subsection.

If you think that you do want to pursue a career, then you'll want to buoy your knowledgebase with understanding Information Technology (IT) & Computer Science (CompSci) fundamentals more broadly; these are the parent domains that the cybersecurity profession was built upon and whose foundations extend into much of the work we do to this day. Some people pursue degrees for example, although [this is certainly not the only approach to consider](https://bytebreach.com/posts/do-i-need-a-degree/).

Related: see the "[What kind of degree?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/wiki/index/#wiki_what_kind_of_degree.3F)" subsection.

Eventually, you'll need to work on improving your employability. This manifests in a variety of ways, but one of the most common (besides fostering a pertinent work history) is accumulating relevant industry-recognized certifications. Working on our employability is a life-long effort that should be thoughtful, deliberate, and carefully planned.

# What is the work like?

Cybersecurity is not a monolith. There are many, many different kinds of roles that exist and all of them have varying responsibilities:

* You have folks who concern themselves with networks: how machines and users engage one-another and how they can communicate safely and securely.
* You have folks concerned with hardware: how humans and machines interface, where systems critical to the health and well-being of dozens (or millions) or people are at stake.
* You have folks concerned with data: how information in all its forms is meaningful, where preserving its integrity and assuring its availability are paramount.
* You have folks who think more strategically: how the "big picture" matters and how that - in turn - leads to organizations prescribing policies for everyone to follow and assuring they are enforced.

Categorically, the various disparate roles and responsibilities that collectively contribute to professional cybersecurity are often lumped together as being either "red" (i.e. offensively-oriented) or "blue" (i.e. defensively-geared). Classically, jobs that lean more "red" might include (but are not limited to):

* Read teamers
* Penetration testers
* AppSec Engineers
* Exploit developers
* Bug Bounty Hunters

While jobs that might lean more "blue" include (but are not limited to):

* Malware analysts
* SOC analysts
* Security Engineers
* GRC functionaries
* Incident Responders

Neither of the above lists are exhaustive by any means. Moreover, any given job is likely to have functional responsibilities that operate more offensively/defensively at times. Occassionally, the color-coding schema of red/blue invokes "purple" teams, where traditionally offensively-oriented staff are embedded with defensively-geared staff in order to make both better at their respective jobs.

> Note: This color-coding schema is independent of black/grey/white -hat activities (which denote a legal/ethical scale of behaviors from criminal to law-abiding) and white/grey/black -box activities (which reflect a knowledge scale of behind-the-curtain foresight for a given event from complete disclosure to full-discovery).

Your best bet to figuring out what a day-in-the-life is like in cybersecurity would be to first more narrowly discover what it is you want to do within the space. Just remember that ultimately each of us is - in some way - concerned with promoting a greater degree of confidence that the technologies we engage with operate in the way they are intended to.

## Career Orientation Resources

Below are a list of resources for learning about the various roles that collectively contribute to the professional domain:

* [The NICE Framework](https://niccs.cisa.gov/tools/cyber-career-pathways-tool?filter=on-ramps) - managed by CISA - allows you to filter cybersecurity subdomains against related areas that they refer to as "on-ramps". These on-ramps can be clicked on for suggested functional job titles, helping inform you of cyber-adjacent lines of work you might consider.
* [Cyberseek](https://www.cyberseek.org/pathway.html) - a tool managed by NICE, CompTIA, and Lightcast - publishes cybersecurity workforce data, including rough trends relating to career pathways.
* [Paul Jerimy's Security Career Roadmap](https://pauljerimy.com/it-career-roadmap/) is an independently maintained roadmap that plugs example titles from the NICE workforce framework against Glass Door compensation data.
* The SANS Institute has published [a nice flier with what they call "The Coolest Careers In Cyber"](https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltabe50a4554f8e97f/blt692c8c0b828b1582/SANS_Poster_Coolest_Careers_English.pdf); subjectivity aside, it's nice to get a quick overview/summary of a lot of jobs with relation to one another.
* The InfoSec Institute maintains [a podcast series titled "What does an X do?"](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/podcast/?Type=Career+Series); these interviews with people from all across the workforce help provide direct insights into the various roles and their functional responsibilities.

# Do I need a degree?

Short answer: not strictly, but it's probably advisable.

Per [ISACA's State of Cybersecurity 2025 report](https://www.isaca.org/state-of-cybersecurity), a majority of employers worldwide require entry-level cybersecurity professionals to have a university degree (as high as 82% in India to as low as 44% in Europe). While previous decades romanticized the closeted renegade hacker going pro, data shows that there are more-and-more graduates with degrees entering the workforce than in years past (making the non-degree job-seeker's job hunting experience tougher than ever); [according to datausa.io](https://datausa.io/profile/cip/computer-information-systems-security), the number of Computer & Information Systems Security degrees awarded *per year* has more than tripled in the last decade.

According to the [2024 US National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics evaluation of cybersecurity workforce supply and demand](https://ncses.nsf.gov/760/assets/0/files/ncses-cwdi-supply-demand-report.pdf), more than 2 out of 3 workers surveyed held a bachelors degree or higher. This marries-up with the [U.S. Office of Personnel Management's Cyber Workforce Dashboard](https://www.opm.gov/data/data-products/cyber-workforce-dashboard/), reporting roughly a combined 61% of the U.S. federal cybersecurity workforce as having a bachelors degree or greater. This likewise matches [research out of Northern Michigan University](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1246234.pdf), which reported 60% of entry-level jobs listings on Dice.com as requiring a college degree in a related field.

Having said all that, the most impactful asset to your employability in the professional domain of cybersecurity is in having a relevant work history. According to the [2024 ISC2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study](https://www.isc2.org/Insights/2024/10/ISC2-2024-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Study), 73% of respondents said having worked in an IT position was "very valuable" to their cybersecurity career growth (vs. only 48% for a bachelors or postbaccalaureate degree). Likewise, the ISACA report noted 72% of employers felt prior hands-on cybersecurity experience was "very important" in determining if a cybersecurity candidate is qualified for the job (vs. 20% for a University degree).

Choosing to pursue a career in cybersecurity *without* going for a degree [is not without it's own risks](https://bytebreach.com/posts/do-i-need-a-degree/). Generally, the common methods include:

* [Cyber-adjacent employment](https://niccs.cisa.gov/tools/cyber-career-pathways-tool?filter=on-ramps) + independent studies before externally job-hopping
* Internally pivoting within your existing employer
* Military service

## What kind of degree?

A Bachelors of Science (BS) degree is generally preferable to an Associates degree or a Bachelors of Arts (BA). If you're considering university, you probably want to study a more technical subject-matter area. While this naturally includes majors like "cybersecurity", "cyber information systems", and "information security" it can also extend to include such majors as:

* Computer Science
* Information Technology
* Information Assurance
* Software Engineering
* Computer Engineering

...and so on.

In fact, some of the more generalized academic disciplines like Computer Science tend to have more uniform "core" curricula at the undergraduate level and expose you to extracurriculars you might not otherwise (e.g. operating systems, AI/ML, etc.). Standalone cybersecurity programs in academia are newer by comparison; as such, there is no such agreed-upon understanding between institutions as to what should constitute a "core" cybersecurity curricula:

* Some are spun-off of existing related departments (i.e. CompSci, IT, etc.)
* Some model their curricula off of third-party vendor certifications (popularly: [Western Governors University](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/cybersecurity-information-assurance-bachelors-program.html) or [SANS](https://www.sans.edu/cyber-security-programs/bachelors-degree/))
* Some adopt an awkward schema of dropping academically-intensive coursework (e.g. mathematics and algorithm analysis) for more holistic ones (e.g. psychology, criminal justice, business, etc.)

Point being, it's important not to take a program's quality at face-value. As with any university acceptance decision, you should audit your prospective school's programs of interest in order to get a better sense of whether or not it aligns with your academic objectives. Some considerations in no particular order:

* Affordable tuition
* Interesting subject matter
* Engaged faculty and teaching assistants
* Frequently updated/modernized curricula
* Research opportunities + fellowships
* Employer-linkage programs

## What about graduate school?

Generally, there are some really narrow criteria for who is best served by a graduate degree. For people who already have an undergraduate degree in a related field, you're typically better served by cultivating your work history (vs. doubling-down on formal education). There are diminishing (though non-zero) returns when considering...

* ...[the impact of a degree to your employability when compared to your employment experiences](https://bytebreach.com/assets/images/isaca_survey.PNG)
* ...[how fewer than a quarter of available jobs list a graduate degree as even being "nice to have"](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1246234.pdf)
* ...and the amount of overlap in subject-matter from undergraduate to graduate studies.

The common reason(s) someone might reasonably consider graduate school:

* If you're interested in working professionally within academia. If so, you probably want to pursue all the way through to your PhD.
* If you're aiming for a particular General Schedule (GS) payband within the U.S. federal gov't.
* If you're looking to work in cryptography more narrowly (owing to the increased amount of mathematical rigor).
* If it helps with immigration/working abroad (i.e. a student visa).
* If your undergraduate degree was in an unrelated field of study and you're a career-changer early in transitioning.
* If you weren't able to attain internships or otherwise foster your work history in tandem with your studies, requiring the additional time to do so.
* If you have a full-ride scholarship.

Outside of the above, it's generally more practical to focus on fostering a pertinent work history instead.

## What about bootcamps?

Bootcamps have emerged in the last decade or so as a self-ascribed alternatives to formal education. They typically take the form of X-week or Y-month training programs, usually tying their curricula towards helping study for one or more foundational certifications. We urge anyone considering a bootcamp to carefully scrutinize the offering, as students typically assume outsized risk in considering them (vs. simply independently studying or going to university). Your moderation team notes that links to some vendors have been banned from this subreddit owing to link farming and other ethically questionable practices observed.

Please exercise caution.

# How do I find a job?

Looking for cybersecurity work can be a really stressful endeavor for people, especially if you are changing careers, were unexpectedly terminated, or are early-on in your career. If you've never gone looking for work before or it's been a while since you last were looking for a job, it's important to bear in mind that the job hunting experience may have changed since even a few years ago.

Job hunting is a multi-step process. It helps to understand how your efforts affect particular steps (and may not impact others). Roughly speaking, the steps can be broken down as:

* Formatting your resume
* Finding job opportunities and applying to them
* Interviewing
* Improving your employability

## Formatting your resume
  1. See [/r/EngineeringResumes](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/)
  2. [This blog post](https://bytebreach.com/posts/how-to-write-an-infosec-resume/) on formatting considerations
  3. Remember that a CV is an exhaustive document while a resume is a more tailored one; use the former to draft the latter.
  4. US federal job opportunities follow a [very strict format](https://www.sec.gov/jobs/sample-resume/sample-resume.pdf), which you'll likely have to adjust for if you seek to work there.
  5. In general, make sure you include a relevant work history with [quantifiable metrics](https://smetrics.lavenix.com/), [pertinent certifications](https://bytebreach.com/posts/what-certifications-should-you-get/), and your formal education. Optionally supplement with sections like Project, Skills, and a professional summary.

## Finding job opportunities and applying to them
  1. Use job opening sites (like [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/)) to find work, but apply for jobs you find directly through the employer's respective "Careers" portal on their site.
  2. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) is (arguably) better as a social media platform than a jobs listing website. You should cultivate your profile on their to attain better exposure for recruiters to find you.
  3. If you're looking to work for the US Federal Gov't directly, you'll want to reference [USAjobs](https://www.usajobs.gov/). For US contractors, you'll probably want to consult [ClearanceJobs](https://www.clearancejobs.com/) instead (assuming you already hold an active security clearance).
  4. For students, you might also want to consider looking at [Handshake](https://joinhandshake.com/) (a platform geared towards students and new graduates)
  5. It's important to realize that the overwhelming majority of your job applications will go without reply or will be ultimately rejected. Early-career applicants especially should be prepared to face a long application period with the total number of applications reaching the dozens/hundreds.
  6. The highest application:interview conversion ratio methods are those which directly involve a human being in the process. Think recruiters/headhunters, job fairs, internal recommendations, etc. Getting a person involved in handling your resume *significantly* improves the odds of a callback.
  7. For early career applicants: bear in mind you likely do not have the leverage to be selective about your first cybersecurity job. While you should certainly apply to jobs you want, we would encourage you to apply to *any* cybersecurity job (or even cyber-adjacent job) just to get your career going. It's easier to pivot into a line of work from a position of experience than it is to directly get into your chosen specialty.

## Improving your employability
  1. [Leverage free resources to hone your craft or acquire new skills](https://bytebreach.com/posts/hacking-helpers-learning-cybersecurity/)
  2. Pursue in-demand certifications
  3. Vie for top placement in [competitive CTF competitions](https://ctftime.org/)
  4. Foster a professional network through in-person meetups (e.g. BSides, OWASP chapter) and [conferences](https://infosec-conferences.com/)
  5. Take note of your interview feedback and track your efforts; consider expanding the aperture of jobs considered to include cyber-adjacent lines of work to build up relevant years of experience.
  6. Consider a degree-granting program
  7. Post your resume for feedback in the Mentorship Monday thread
  8. Apply your skills into some projects
