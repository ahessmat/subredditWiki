# What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of securing computer systems, networks, and data from attacks, outages, and other complications (typically malicious in nature, though not exclusively). The professional domain of cybersecurity is broad, being inclusive of hyper-specialized technical subject-matter experts, strategic policy implementers, criminal investigators, and more. That breadth is extended by the considerable depth that each respective field/subfield possesses. The work involved in securing the technology we all own, use, and operate every day is a mammoth collective effort.

# I'm new to Cybersecurity; where do I begin?

If you are newer to the space, it can be really challenging wrapping your head around cybersecurity as a profession (let alone what you need to learn/perform in order to become a part of it).

Early on, you're going to want to learn more about the industry in order to help inform your decision about whether or not cybersecurity is for you; such knowledge will also help guide your initial career trajectory based on what roles/responsibilities look attractive. Know this however: careers in this space typically do not manifest quickly, easily, or cheaply. Most people invest years of their lives (and a non-trivial amount of out-of-pocket expenses in college tuition / certification exam fees) before they attain their first full-time cybersecurity job - let alone the one they are envisioning doing.

If you think that you do want to pursue a career, then you'll want to buoy your knowledgebase with understanding Information Technology (IT) & Computer Science (CompSci) fundamentals more broadly; these are the parent domains that the cybersecurity profession was built upon and whose foundations extend into much of the work we do to this day. Some people pursue degrees for example, although [this is certainly not the only approach to consider](https://bytebreach.com/posts/do-i-need-a-degree/).

Eventually, you'll need to work on improving your employability. This manifests in a variety of ways, but one of the most common (besides fostering a pertinent work history) is accumulating relevant industry-recognized certifications. Working on our employability is a life-long effort that should be thoughtful, deliberate, and carefully planned.
